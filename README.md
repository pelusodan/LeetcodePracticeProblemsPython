# Leetcode Practice Problems in Python
A collection of practice problems I'll be working on for interview prep. I got the idea of making it a public repo so I could track my progress and motivate myself to solve problems every day.

### Organization

I'll be making each problem a new python file with the filename based off the problem name and number on Leetcode. 

### Running

Leetcode has a designated solution class most times, but to make things easier I'll be running them from the same simple 'main.py' script.
